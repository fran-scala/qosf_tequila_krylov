    """Functions that allows to calculate different quantities 
       depending on the passed parameters:
       1) If only ket is passed, returns the overlap with itself (1).
       2) If ket and bra are passed, returns the overlap between the two states.
       3) If ket and operator are passed, returns the expectation value of the operator fot the given state.
       4) If ket, bra and operator are passed, returns the transition element of the operator.

    Args:
        ket (QCircuit): QCircuit corresponding to a state. 
        bra (QCircuit, optional): QCircuit corresponding to a second state.
                                  Defaults to None.
